## A

## B

The posterior is a proper pdf because it has the form of a known distributino, the Gamma distribution.

## C

```{r}
#sum of all data = 154.5
n <- 8

a <- .1
b <- 1
th <- seq(0,1, length = 500)

x <- 154.5 #not sure if this is actually correct


like <- (th^n)*exp(-th*x)
prior <- dgamma(th, a, b)
post <- dgamma(th, n+a, x-b)

#plot the likelihood function
plot(th, like, type = "l", ylab = "Density", lty = 3, lwd = 3, xlab = expression(theta))

#plot the prior distribution
plot(th, prior, type = "l", ylab = "Density", lty = 3, lwd = 3, xlab = expression(theta))

#plot the posterior distribution
plot(th, post, type = "l", ylab = "Density", lty = 3, lwd = 3, xlab = expression(theta))

#plot the prior and posterior together
plot(th, prior, col = "blue", type = "l", ylab = "Density", lty = 3, lwd = 3, xlab = expression(theta))
lines(th, post, col = "red", type = "l", lty = 3, lwd = 3)
legend(0.5, 20, legend = c("Prior", "Posterior"), col = c("blue", "red"), lwd = c(3,3), lty = c(3,3))
```



## D

An exponential model is typically used to model the expected time until an event occurs. This event could be the time from now until the next hurricane strikes Florida. 

An exponential model would not be a good fit for something like the number of times that an individual will experience a hurricane in his/her/their lifetime.
