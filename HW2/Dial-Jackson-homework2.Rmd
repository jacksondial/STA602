# Q2

## A

_Insert image here_

## B

The posterior is a proper pdf because it has the form of a known distributino, the Gamma distribution.

## C

```{r}
#sum of all data = 154.5
n <- 8

a <- .1
b <- 1
th <- seq(0,1, length = 500)

x <- 154.5 #not sure if this is actually correct


like <- dgamma(th, n + .1, x - 1)
prior <- dgamma(th, a, b)
post <- dgamma(th, n+a, x-b)

plot(th, like, type = "l", ylab = "Density", lty = 3, lwd = 3, xlab = expression(theta))
```
